This program will be able to make any job of a Dungeon Master of keeping track of initiative, enemy and ally stats,
and looking up information on the fly. The Dungeon Master would be able to set up enemies for a fighting session by
entering the name of the combatants and the Initiative Tracker would roll the dice and place them in the correct order
based on turn. Then the Dungeon Master would add the players' initiative then once combat starts, whoever turn it is
will display a picture and all relevant stats.
